an advanced, next-generation additive manufacturing process for
making complex parts with features that cannot be produced by any
other method. Parts are created on a special machine layer-by-layer,
and this unique process lets you – the product designer – add
internal features like conformal cooling channels and lattice
structures reduce weight while preserving strength. Because the
process is completely computer controlled, you are also able to
modify features quickly and easily without additional expense,
allowing you to test different versions of a prototype fast.

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">PCB (Printed Circuit Board) is a
thin board where the electronic components, which are in pairs and
assemblies, where the sides are made of copper lining to solder the
legs of the components. PCB can be more than 1 layer, which I know
maximum up to 12 layer.PCB is made of fiber material or the like on
the non conductive part. The thickness of copper on PCB is various,
there are 35 micrometer there is also<SPAN LANG="id-ID"> </SPAN>17-18
micrometer<BR><BR><BR>

<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.11in">Other PCB materials are phenolic or
pertinax paper, usually brown, this type of material is more popular
because of its cheaper price.For PCB in use for Through hole plating,
usually wearing a fiberglass, because the fungus does not like this
material, and The material is stronger and not easy to bend in
comparison with pertinax.PCB can be found in almost all electronic
equipment, such as radio, mobile, television, and others.</P>
